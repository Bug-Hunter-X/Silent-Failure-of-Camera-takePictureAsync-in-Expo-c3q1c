# Silent Failure of Expo Camera takePictureAsync

This repository demonstrates a common, yet elusive, bug in Expo's Camera API. The `takePictureAsync` method may fail silently if called before the camera is fully initialized.  This leads to unexpected behavior without any clear error messages.

## Bug Description
The issue stems from calling `takePictureAsync` before the camera has finished loading.  This results in no picture being taken and no error being thrown, making it difficult to debug.

## Reproduction
The `bug.js` file contains code that reproduces this issue. Observe that the photo isn't taken, and there is no console error to assist in troubleshooting.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version. By utilizing the `Camera.getStatusAsync` method to ensure the camera is ready, reliable picture capture is achieved.
